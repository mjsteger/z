Z is a tool to allow you to easily hop to where you are going in the shell, without having to type out a long pathname every time. If you find yourself constantly doing ```cd /long/path/that/is/annoying/```, then you can simply do ```z -a shortname /long/path/that/is/annoying```, and then every time after that, simply ```z shortname``` in order to go to that directory.

### Setup
`git clone git@github.com:mjsteger/z.git ~/.z`

Then, in the shell configuration of your choice(i.e., .zshrc or .bashrc), simply add ```source $HOME/.z/z.sh```
